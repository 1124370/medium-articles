To be able to render the 3D models in your browser, the HTML file needs to be served by a server.

You can use, for example, the [serve library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) as explained in the [article](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-render-your-3d-models-on-the-web-with-model-viewer-1c389a513855), the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for Visual Studio Code, etc.
